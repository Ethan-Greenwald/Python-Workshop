    "**Functions** are coding tools that can make your program more efficient to type, more readable, and more concise. After a **function** is defined (created), it can be called at any time later in the code. Functions, in the most general sense, take some number (possibly zero) input variables, and can spit something out.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three main parts to a function: The header, the body, and the return statement. The header is where the function is actually defined (using **def**, a function name, and parentheses) and any input variables are specified. Those variables are put in the parentheses separated by commas. The body is code that executes when the function is called, and the return statement is the ending of the function. Return statements let you send something back to where the function was called, letting you use functions to assign values to variables and so forth. Here's an example of how to define and call a basic function:"
