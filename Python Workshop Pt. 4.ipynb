    "Again - one final note: Do NOT just use this, or any other tool, to just solve your homework. It's important to understand linear algebra by itself and not with the assistance of Python. Programming is a tool to apply your knowledge in a more efficient way, not to replace that knowledge. Good luck with the rest of the course and continue learning more about programming! If you ever need help with a specific function in NumPy or just forgot how it works exactly, go to the documentation [here](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/routines.linalg.html)! Have fun!"
