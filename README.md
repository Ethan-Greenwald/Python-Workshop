# Python-Workshop
These are Jupyter notebooks to be used as supplementary material for a Python workshop.

For UIUC MATH 257 students wanting to write in their own notebook copies:
* Download the notebooks as `.ipynb` files
* Open PrairieLearn and go to one of the lab environments (the original Python tutorial CL1 works just fine)
* Drag the downloaded notebooks into the workspace sidebar, underneath the included `.ipynb` file
* Double-click to open the notebook and interact with individual cells
* Become a Python god


## Topics Covered
* Part 1 covers the basic ideas of what variables are, including strings, integers, and floats. It also deals with
  commenting code, as well as the general concept of a datatype.
* Part 2 begins by talking about the boolean datatype and then going into if statements and while loops.
  Lists are briefly covered before explaining for loops and their ability to iterate more efficiently.
* Part 3 is dedicated to describing what functions are and how they benefit your code, as well as how to 
  implement them in Python. Tuples are also talked about as a way to explain "packaging" data into one place.
* Part 4 is an introduction to using NumPy as it relates to linear algebra. It covers basic array/matrix
  creation, as well as some basic linear algebra functions from `numpy.linalg`
