# Python-Workshop
These are Jupyter notebooks to be used as supplementary material for a Python workshop.

For UIUC MATH 257 students wanting to write in their own notebook copies:
* Download the notebooks as .ipynb files
* Open PrairieLearn and go to one of the lab environments (the original Python tutorial CL1 works just fine)
* Drag the downloaded notebooks into the workspace sidebar, underneath the included .ipynb file
* Double-click to open the notebook and interact with individual cells
* Become a Python god
