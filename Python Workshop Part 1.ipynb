    "\n",
    "Variables are at the heart of any programming language. At the most basic level, they're what let you save information and do things with it later.\n",
    "\n",
    "Variables have two parts to them: A name and data. Names can be anything you want, as long as they don't start with a number and don't have any spaces. You also can't name a variable with something Python uses already (like **if** or **for** as we'll see later on). Data is a little more complicated, as there are many many different kinds of data, refered to as different **datatypes**. You don't need to ever tell Python what datatype you're using, however - it'll figure it out on its own. You can define a variable by first typing its name, then an '=', and then whatever value you want to assign to it (this includes other variables!).\n",
